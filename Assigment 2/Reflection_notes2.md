## Encoding the printed french press
<p>The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) holds all the printed press among its collections. These collections have been the subject, for several years, of a digitization and online dissemination policy to resolve issues of conservation and communication. The BnF makes it available on its digital library named Gallica (https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/fr/html/accueil-fr) through a set of raster images associated with OCR (Optical Character Recognition).</p>

<p>During a digitization and online dissemination operation of documentary resources, it is possible to distinguish the physical and logical structure of a document. For a press document the layout and graphic formatting of the content make its referencing more complex (title banner, forefront, division into columns, division into articles, image blocks, etc.), with multiple ways of reading and interpreting.</p>

<p>Our project aims to propose an XML encoding based on the standards defined by the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for press document type.
