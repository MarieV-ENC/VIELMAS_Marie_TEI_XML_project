# VIELMAS_Marie_TEI_XML_project
XML-TEI modelling project (course by Katarzyna Kapitan - M2 TNAH ENC 2025

## Repository introduction
<p>This directory contains all the digital files produced as part of the educational project to encode several samples of heritage sources in XML-TEI.</p>

<p>The directory is organised into several tabs:
- Assignment 1: folder containing three XML files associated with a DTD file, with a reflection note (submission date : 20 October 2025)
- Assignment 2: folder containing three TEI XML files with a reflection note on TEI encoding and textual transcriptions of material sources (submission date: 17 November 2025)
- Assignment 3: submission date 22 December 2025
- Source material: folder containing three sample sources.

## Project description
<p>This project is based on a general reflection on the digitisation and online publication of printed documents from heritage collections in accordance with conservation and public communication objectives.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in the printed pess collections held at Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) under the legal deposit system.</p>

<p>The printed press has been the subject of a major digitisation and online publication campaign over several years, resources available on BnF's digital library, Gallica (URL: https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/fr/html/accueil-fr), through a set of image files associated with OCR (Optical Character Recognition).</p>

<p>Printed press is a type of document for which the physical and logical structure is particularly complex to determine due to a multitude of readings and interpretations ways.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is therefore to analyse the material, logical and textual structure of press documents and propose an XML encoding for them based on the standards defined by the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), while also offering a reflection on and comparison of different technical processes.</p>

## Source description
<p>We selected a sample of three samples of the French newspaper 'La Dépêche' printed during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries:
- La Dépêche: journal quotidien, 4 April 1875 (URL: https://rosalis.bibliotheque.toulouse.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4107240d)
- La Dépêche: journal quotidien, 19 August 1944 (URL: https://rosalis.bibliotheque.toulouse.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4149943s/f1.image#)
- La Dépêche du Midi, 6 November 2025 (URL: https://kiosque.ladepeche.fr/la-depeche-du-midi/edition-toulouse/2025-11-06)</p>

<p>'La Dépêche' is a regional daily newspaper founded in Toulouse on 2 October 1870. The newspaper was published for nearly 70 years before being banned for collaborationism at the end of the Second World War. The newspaper was revived under the title 'La Dépêche du Midi' and is still published today.</p>

<p>The samples chosen correspond to the first issue published (on the 4th of April 1875), the last issue published before publication was banned (the 19th of August 1944) and the contemporary issue of 6th of November 2025. Through these examples, we wish to offer a reflection on the logical structure of the organisation of information over time.</p>
<p>Due to the length of the press articles, our work focuses **only** on the textual information in the articles on the front page. Only one or two articles will be encoded in the digital files.</p>
